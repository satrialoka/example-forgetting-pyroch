# example-forgetting-pyroch

Easy pytorch implementation for calculating forgetting statistics from ["An Empirical Study of Example Forgetting during Deep Neural Network Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05159)paper. 

Resnet + Cutout implementations were taken from [cutout](https://github.com/uoguelph-mlrg/Cutout)
